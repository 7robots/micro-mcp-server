**macOS:**
```bash
# Option 1: Homebrew (recommended)
brew install python@3.10

# Option 2: Download from python.org
# Visit https://python.org and download Python 3.10+
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Option 1: Download from python.org (recommended)
# Visit https://python.org and download Python 3.10+

# Option 2: Microsoft Store
# Search for "Python 3.10" in Microsoft Store
```

**Linux:**

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3.10
```

### Building from Source

If you want to build from source:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7robots/micro-mcp-server.git
   cd micro-mcp-server/python-dxt-extension
   ```

2. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```

3. **Install in Claude Desktop** as described above

## Configuration

### Bearer Token Setup

You'll need a bearer token from Micro.blog to authenticate API requests:

1. **Log into your Micro.blog account**
2. **Go to Account Settings**
3. **Generate or copy your API bearer token**
4. **Enter this token during extension installation**

The token is stored securely in your local configuration and is only used to make API requests to Micro.blog on your behalf.

## Usage

Once installed, you can ask Claude to help manage your books. Here are some example commands:

### Getting Information
- "Show me all my bookshelves"
- "What books are in my 'Currently Reading' bookshelf?"
- "What are my reading goals for this year?"
- "How much progress have I made on goal 123?"

### Managing Bookshelves
- "Create a new bookshelf called 'Science Fiction'"
- "Rename bookshelf 5 to 'Favorites'"

### Managing Books
- "Add 'Project Hail Mary' by Andy Weir to my 'Currently Reading' bookshelf"
- "Move book 79 to bookshelf 23"
- "Remove book 45 from bookshelf 12"
- "Change the cover of book 67 in bookshelf 8 to this URL: https://example.com/cover.jpg"

### Managing Reading Goals
- "Update my reading goal 1 to target 25 books"
- "Set my progress on goal 2 to 15 books read"

## Python vs Node.js Versions

This repository provides two DXT implementations:

- **Node.js Version** (`dxt-extension/`): Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Python Version** (`python-dxt-extension/`): Uses `fastmcp` - this version

Both provide identical functionality. Choose based on your preference or specific requirements.

## Security & Privacy

- **Local Operation**: This extension runs entirely on your local machine
- **Secure Token Storage**: Your bearer token is stored securely in Claude Desktop's configuration
- **API-Only Access**: The extension only makes API calls to Micro.blog's official endpoints
- **No Data Collection**: No usage data is collected or transmitted to third parties
- **Open Source**: The code is open source and auditable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bearer token is required" error**:
   - Make sure you've entered your Micro.blog bearer token during installation
   - Verify the token is valid by checking your Micro.blog account settings

2. **"Network error" messages**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that micro.blog is accessible from your network
   - Check if you're behind a corporate firewall that might block the requests

3. **"HTTP 401" or authentication errors**:
   - Your bearer token may have expired or been revoked
   - Generate a new token in your Micro.blog account settings
   - Reinstall the extension with the new token

4. **Extension not appearing in Claude Desktop**:
   - Ensure you're using Claude Desktop version 0.7.0 or higher
   - Check that the extension package was installed correctly

5. **Python-related errors**:
   - The extension bundles its own Python dependencies, so system Python issues shouldn't affect it
   - If building from source, ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
