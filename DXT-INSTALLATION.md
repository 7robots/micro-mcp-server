# Desktop Extension (DXT) Installation Guide

This guide will help you install the Micro.blog Books MCP Server as a Desktop Extension (DXT) in Claude Desktop.

## What is a Desktop Extension (DXT)?

Desktop Extensions are a new way to install MCP servers as single-click extensions, similar to browser extensions. They provide:

- âœ… **Easy installation** - Just install a `.dxt` file
- âœ… **Automatic dependency management** - No need to install Node.js packages manually
- âœ… **Secure configuration** - Tokens stored securely in Claude Desktop
- âœ… **One-click setup** - No command line required

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Desktop** version 0.7.0 or higher
- **Micro.blog account** with API access
- **Internet connection** for API calls

## Installation Steps

### 1. Get Your Micro.blog Bearer Token

1. Log into your [Micro.blog account](https://micro.blog)
2. Go to **Account Settings**
3. Find or generate your **API bearer token**
4. Copy this token (you'll need it in step 3)

### 2. Download the Extension

You have two options:

#### Option A: Download Pre-built Extension
- Download `micro-blog-books.dxt` from the [releases page](https://github.com/7robots/micro-mcp-server/releases)

#### Option B: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/7robots/micro-mcp-server.git
cd micro-mcp-server/dxt-extension
npm install
npm run build
```
This creates `micro-blog-books.dxt` in the `dxt-extension` directory.

### 3. Install in Claude Desktop

1. **Open Claude Desktop**
2. **Go to Settings** (gear icon)
3. **Navigate to Extensions**
4. **Click "Install Extension"**
5. **Select the `.dxt` file** you downloaded/built
6. **Enter your bearer token** when prompted
7. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### 4. Verify Installation

Ask Claude something like:
- "Show me my bookshelves"
- "What are my reading goals?"

If the extension is working, Claude will be able to access your Micro.blog books data!

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
