## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bearer token is required" error**:
   - Make sure you've entered your Micro.blog bearer token during installation
   - Verify the token is valid by checking your Micro.blog account settings

2. **"Network error" messages**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that micro.blog is accessible from your network
   - Check if you're behind a corporate firewall that might block the requests

3. **"HTTP 401" or authentication errors**:
   - Your bearer token may have expired or been revoked
   - Generate a new token in your Micro.blog account settings
   - Reinstall the extension with the new token

4. **Extension not appearing in Claude Desktop**:
   - Ensure you're using Claude Desktop version 0.7.0 or higher
   - Verify Node.js 18.0.0+ is installed on your system
   - Check that the extension package was installed correctly

```bash
cd dxt-extension
export MICRO_BLOG_BEARER_TOKEN="your_token_here"
